Exploring the Ancient Ruins of Machu Picchu
Machu Picchu, often referred to as the "Lost City of the Incas," is a 15th-century Inca citadel located in the Eastern Cordillera of southern Peru, on a mountain ridge 2,430 meters (7,970 ft) above sea level. It is located in the Machupicchu District within Urubamba Province above the Sacred Valley, which is 80 kilometers (50 mi) northwest of Cuzco.
Historical Significance
Machu Picchu was built in the classical Inca style, with polished dry-stone walls. Its primary buildings are the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows. These are located in what is known by archaeologists as the Sacred District of Machu Picchu. The site was believed to be constructed as an estate for the Inca emperor Pachacuti (1438–1472).
Rediscovery
Although known locally, it was largely unknown to the outside world before being brought to international attention in 1911 by the American historian Hiram Bingham. Bingham returned to Peru in 1912 with the sponsorship of Yale University and National Geographic and began extensive clearing and excavation.
Tourism and Preservation
Machu Picchu is a UNESCO World Heritage Site and was designated as a Historical Sanctuary of Peru in 1981 and a World Heritage Site in 1983. Since it was not plundered by the Spanish during their conquest, it is especially important as a cultural site. Its construction style and design are marvels of ancient engineering and astronomy.
Due to its popularity and fragile condition, the Peruvian government has placed limits on the number of visitors allowed each day, aiming to preserve the site for future generations. Efforts include restoring damaged structures, monitoring visitor impact, and educating tourists on responsible travel practices.
Visitor Experience
Visitors to Machu Picchu can explore various structures and terraces that once served as homes, ceremonial sites, and agricultural areas. The hike up Huayna Picchu, the mountain that overlooks the ruins, provides a stunning panoramic view of the entire site and the surrounding valleys.
Whether arriving via the famous Inca Trail or by train from Cusco, the experience of exploring Machu Picchu offers a unique glimpse into the ingenuity and culture of the Inca civilization. It stands as a testament to human creativity and endurance amidst the breathtaking backdrop of the Andes Mountains.
